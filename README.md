# balanced_bst

A project from The Odin Project to learn Binary Search Trees.

In this project I learned:
 - a great deal about recursion
 - how to build the tree through recursion
 - inserting and deleting nodes, finding a specific node
 - Breadth-first search (level order traversal)
 - Depth-first search (preorder, inorder, and postorder traversal)
 - calculating height and depth of a node
 - determining if a tree is balanced or not
 - rebalancing the tree
